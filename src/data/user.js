	about: {
		title: "I’m Muneeb khan, You can call me a full-snack developer ;).",
		description:
			`Hi, I’m a developer who genuinely enjoys building things from scratch and breaking them until they work better. I spend most of my time writing JavaScript, React, Node, and Python, and an even bigger chunk of time debugging everything I just wrote.
			
			I’m the kind of person who learns fast, experiments a lot, and doesn’t wait to be “ready” before starting something — whether it’s building full production ready websites in a few days, writing my own APIs, or diving into complex topics like blockchain and AI just because I’m curious.

			I like solving problems that feel slightly above my level because that’s where I grow the most. If something looks complicated, it motivates me, not scares me. I’m comfortable staying up late with bugs, cleaning messy code, and turning ideas into actual working products.

			Beyond the tech side, I’m practical, focused, and pretty honest with myself — if I don’t know something, I learn it. If I get stuck, I keep pushing. And I’m aiming for a strong career in software engineering, not just for the job, but because I genuinely enjoy this craft.`,
